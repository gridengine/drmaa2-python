UGE DRMAA v2 Python API
=======================

Prerequisites
-------------

UGE DRMAA2 requires recent versions of the following software:

1. UGE (8.6.8 or above)
2. Python (v2.7.5 or later in 2.7 series, or in any 3.x series)
3. Setuptools (0.9.8 or later; for egg installation)
4. Nose (1.3.7 or later; for testing)
5. Sphinx (1.1.3 or later; for generating documentation)
6. Standard development tools (make)
7. Python wheel module (0.32.3 or later; for generating wheel package)
8. enum34 module for IntEnum (remove enum module)

The software versions listed above were used for API development and
testing, on CentOS 7.2 (64-bit).

Build/Package
-------------

In the top level directory run:

.. code:: sh

     $ make clean
     $ make

This command should create installable egg and wheel packages, as well
as generate documentation and copy it into the ``dist`` directory.

Basic API Usage
---------------

For simple testing, without installing UGE DRMAA2 egg or wheel package,
do the following:

1) Setup SGE environment:

.. code:: sh

     $ source $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/settings.sh

2) Setup PYTHONPATH environment variable to point to the top level
   directory:

.. code:: sh

     $ export PYTHONPATH=<UGE_DRMAA2_PYTHON_ROOT>

This step is not needed if UGE DRMAA2 egg or wheel package is installed.

3) At this point you can import and use the drmaa2 module:

.. code:: sh

     $ python
     >>> import drmaa2
     >>> print(drmaa2.get_drmaa_name())
     Univa Grid Engine Drmaa V2

Note that there are a number of API usage examples located under the
``examples`` directory.

Running Test Suite
------------------

1) Setup SGE environment:

.. code:: sh

     $ source $SGE_ROOT/$SGE_CELL/common/settings.sh

2) In the top level directory run:

.. code:: sh

     $ make test
